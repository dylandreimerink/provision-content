Description: "Prep a cluster with prerequisite packages."
Name: "krib-pkg-prep"
Documentation: |
  Installs prerequisite OS packages prior to starting KRIB 
  install process.  In some use cases this may be a faster
  pattern than performing the steps in the standard templates.

  For example - Sledgehammer Discover nodes, add 'krib-prep-pkgs'
  stage.  As machine is finishing prep - you can move to setting
  up other things, before kicking off the KRIB workflow.

  Uses packages listed in the 'default' Schema section of the 
  Param 'krib/packages-to-prep'.  You can override this list
  by setting the Param in a Profile or directly on the Machines
  to apply this to. 

  Packages MUST exist in the repositories on the Machines already.

OptionalParams:
  - krib/packages-to-prep
Templates:
  - Name: krib-pkg-prep
    Contents: |-
      #!/bin/bash
      # Install prerequisite OS packages prior to KRIB workflow run
      set -e
       
      {{template "setup.tmpl"}}
       
      # only execute the package install if we are have a KRIB
      # cluster profile set - this is a weak check to verify it
      # we're going to becmoe a KRIB cluster
      {{if .ParamExists "krib/cluster-profile"}}
      PKGS="{{.Param "krib/packages-to-prep"}}"
      if [[ -z "$PKGS" ]]; then
        echo "'krib/packates-to-prep' empty - no prep completed."
        exit 0
      else
        echo "Installing prereq packages:  $PKGS"
        install $PKGS
      fi
      {{else}}
      echo "The 'krib/cluster-profile' not found on Machine. Skipping prep."
      exit 0
